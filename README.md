### Rockskeleton is a framework front-end for any websites

Drag-and-drop the same Rockskeleton components to your own design. Easy to integrate with any programming language, you just download the HTML and start coding the design into it.

## Open Source for More Flexibility

Frameworks are incredibly helpful tools for front-end design, especially if you have a job where you’re frequently developing that side. They allow you to speed up your workflow and increase your productivity without sacrificing quality or functionality, while still leaving the door open for a unique, customized look. 

Just to refresh, front-end development is all about the parts of a website that users see, while the back-end is more about the “behind the scenes” functionality.

Using a framework to construct your website’s front-end has a lot of advantages (and is pretty easy to boot!). Let’s go over what front-end frameworks are and why you should consider incorporating them into your web development work.


## No conflict with other css style

### Fantastic! No conflict between stylesheets and javascript scripts because rockskeleton uses the rock- prefix.
